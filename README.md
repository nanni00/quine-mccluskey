# quine-mccluskey-algorithm
A partial implementation of Quine-McCluskey algorithm

It should work; with simple input values (max 100) result is checked by hand or with online programs.
With more complex input it should not give any error (unless input values are wrong), but
the result accuracy is not guaranteed yet. 

Giacomo Salici (https://github.com/jacksalici) helped me in step 1 implementation (thank you very much).
